# R
A program I wrote recently to calculate the correlation coefficient R and the coefficient of determination R^2 from data in lists 1 and 2 or from parameters passed by the user

## Variables Used
Variable|Use|
:-------|:-:|
Various Stat Vars| Used to calculate R and R^2 from data
N| The number of elements in the data set 
X| The sample mean of the X values from the paired data
Y| The sample mean of the Y values from the paired data
Z| The total sum of the squeared X values from the paired data
Theta| the total sum of the squared Y values from the paired data
W| The total sum of multiplied corressponding X and Y values.
R| The result of calculations to obtain the correlation coefficient. Squared to make the soefficient of determination
List 1| One of the lists on which the program runs 2 Var Stats to calculate R and R^2
List 2| One of the lists on which the program runs 2 Var Stats to calculate R and R^2
